            <h4>Learn to become a Backend Developer</h4>
            <p>
              Web development today is completely different from what it was a
              few years ago; there are lots of different things that can easily
              baffle anyone entering into the web development. It was one of the
              reasons that we decided to make these step by step visual guides
              demonstrating the bigger picture and to give anyone a clear idea
              about what they have to follow to be in certain roles in web
              development.

              About a week ago, we had a post titled Learn to become a Frontend
              Developer in which we promised to release the updated roadmaps for
              Backend and DevOps. Holding up to that promise, this article is
              about modern backend developer. If you haven’t checked the
              frontend developer roadmap already, go ahead and give it a look.

            <h4>Achieving success is simpler than you think</h4>
            <p>
              Success is simpler than you think !!!
            </p>
            <p>
              By some metrics, success isn’t very common. After all, the odds of
              building a billion-dollar company are 1.7 million to one. Part of
              the popularity of “success hack” posts likely reflects the elusive
              nature of success. Motivation, I’m sure, also plays a role; we all
              want to achieve our goals and live meaningful lives. But our
              affinity for this type of content reveals something more telling:
              many of us are looking for a shortcut — our own silver bullet to
              help beat the odds. Ultimately, we all want our dreams to come
              true, but few of us are willing to pay the price it takes to get
              there. The truth is, there’s never been a silver bullet for
              finding success.
            </p>

            </div>
            <p>
              Being successful isn’t a stroke of luck, and there’s no magic,
              one-size-fits-all hack for achieving our goals. While success
              might be a bit of a mystery, and it’s most certainly hard-won, it
              doesn’t have to be complicated. Simply put, success comes from
              doing the same thing effectively, over and over.

            <h4>10 Ways to Make Your Content Marketing Go Viral</h4>
            <p>
              How do you send content viral?
            </p>
            <div class="hero-img">
              <img src="../img/content.jpg" alt="" />
            </div>
            <p>
              Viral content is any piece of media that becomes wildly popular
              overnight. It could be a Youtube video, Facebook post, tweet, or
              almost any social media content that gets shared thousands and
              thousands of times. Viral content starts to work for you on
              autopilot, as your brand gets exposed to a whole new audience that
              you couldn’t ever quite reach organically. You might think getting
              your content to go viral is as likely as you hitting the lottery,
              but nothing could be further from the truth. If you’re looking to
              generate buzz for your business or if you just want your own 15
              minutes of fame, continue reading. I’ve put together 10 ways to
              make your content marketing go viral (and none of them involve
              buying a lottery ticket!)
